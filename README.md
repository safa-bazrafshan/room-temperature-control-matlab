# Room Temperature Control Using On-Off and PID Controllers

This project simulates a simple thermal control system using On-Off and PID controllers in MATLAB. The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of each control strategy for maintaining a stable room temperature under normal and disturbed conditions.

## Features
- On-Off controller implementation
- PID controller tuning and simulation
- Response to step input and external disturbances
- Clean plots and analysis

## Files
- onoff_control.m
- pid_control.m
- temperature_model.m
- plots/ — Simulation result plots
- report.pdf — Full report with figures and discussion
